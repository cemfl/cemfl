# Hi 👋 and welcome to my repository!

I'm a marine biologist working on the Darwin Tree of Life project, where we're trying to whole genome sequence all eukaryotes in Britian and Ireland!  🌱 🐛 🐟 🪱🦋🍄🦐🧪

## Currently:
I'm training as a software developer with CoGrammar/HyperionDev, hoping to gain extra skills to help my project and personal development, as well as opening up the potential for a career change.

## Some of my hobbies:
Swimming, Paddle Boarding, TAG Rugby, Nature, Photography.

## Before you go...
Please enjoy a picture of mine, the jellyfish *Catostylus tagi*.
